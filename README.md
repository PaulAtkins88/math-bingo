# math-bingo

Hi there, I started this game with my daughter and it was a bit of fun to code up. She has sinced moved on so I am opening it up to the community to contribute and make better :)

This game is similar to bingo, a user inputs numbers into their grid (or uses the random numbers provided), and rolls the dice. If the number is in the grid, the number will highlight in green. If the user gets a row, column or diagonal of highlighted numbers, they will win.

Feel free to contribute in the standard '[git-flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)' way of working and thank you!
